# Metronome
A metronome especially designed so that you can practice your instruments anywhere without feeling the need to download any extra application.
This application is made using HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

P.S: The 'Tick-Tock' sound is basically me snapping my tongue and then adding tonns of reverb. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
